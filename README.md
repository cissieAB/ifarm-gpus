# Roofline Performance Overview of the JLab `ifarm` GPUs

## Contents

- The 16384 matrixMul on T4 and A100 GPUs with PyTorch Profiler
- [Benchmarking data of GPU measured peak throughput (GFLOPS) and L1/L2/HBM bandwidth (GB/s)](./docs/roofline.md)
- [DeviceQuery and BW results from the CUDA samples](./res/CUDA-samples-utilities)

## TODOs
- [ ] Guide to get the hardware limit of the GPUs
- [ ] Update the GPU Microbenchmark suite to take parameters from the cmd line. And test many sizes instead.
