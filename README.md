# Performance Overview of the JLab `ifarm` GPUs

## Contents

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The PyTorch implementation of ParaDNN
- [Benchmarking data of GPU measured peak throughput (GFLOPS) and L1/L2/HBM bandwidth (GB/s)](./docs/roofline.md)
- [DeviceQuery and BW results from the CUDA samples](./res/CUDA-samples-utilities)

=======
- (*ongoing*) The PyTorch implementation of ParaDNN
- [The measured GPU peak throughput (GFLOPS) and L1/L2/HBM bandwidth (GB/s) for roofline analysis](./docs/roofline.md)
- [DeviceQuery and BWTest results from the CUDA samples](./res/CUDA-samples-utilities)
>>>>>>> 1a75dbd (Add pytorch-fc code and slurm scripts)

## TODOs
- [ ] Guide to get the hardware limit of the GPUs
- [ ] Update the GPU Microbenchmark suite to take parameters from the cmd line. And test many sizes instead.
